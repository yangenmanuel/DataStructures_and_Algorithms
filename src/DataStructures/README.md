## Queue
A queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the 
sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements are added 
is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed is called the head or front of the queue, analogously 
to the words used when people line up to wait for goods or services.

## Priority Queue
A priority queue is an abstract data-type similar to a regular queue or stack data structure. Each element in a priority queue has an associated 
priority. In a priority queue, elements with high priority are served before elements with low priority. In some implementations, 
if two elements have the same priority, they are served in the same order in which they were enqueued. In other implementations, the 
order of elements with the same priority is undefined.
